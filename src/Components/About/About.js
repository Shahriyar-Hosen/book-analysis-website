            Author Luisa Plaja offers her top tips for how to write a brilliant
            review of the latest book you read - whether you liked it or not.
            Other readers will always be interested in your opinion of the books
            you've read. Whether you've loved the book or not, if you give your
            honest and detailed thoughts then people will find new books that
            are right for them. If you're stuck on what to say in a review, it
            can help to imagine you're talking to someone who's asking you
            whether they should read the book.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-10 mb-3 font-semibold text-gray-900">
            1. Start with a couple of sentences describing what the book is
            about
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            But without giving any spoilers or revealing plot twists! As a
            general rule, try to avoid writing in detail about anything that
            happens from about the middle of the book onwards. If the book is
            part of a series, it can be useful to mention this, and whether you
            think you'd need to have read other books in the series to enjoy
            this one.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-10 mb-3 font-semibold text-gray-900">
            2. Discuss what you particularly liked about the book
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            Focus on your thoughts and feelings about the story and the way it
            was told. You could try answering a couple of the following
            questions: Who was your favourite character, and why? Did the
            characters feel real to you? Did the story keep you guessing? What
            was your favourite part of the book, and why? Were certain types of
            scene written particularly well - for example sad scenes, tense
            scenes, mysterious ones...? Did the book make you laugh or cry? Did
            the story grip you and keep you turning the pages?
          </p>

        <div>
          <p class="mt-10 mb-3 font-semibold text-gray-900">
            3. Mention anything you disliked about the book
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            Talk about why you think it didn't work for you. For example: Did
            you wish the ending hadn't been a cliffhanger because you found it
            frustrating? Did you find it difficult to care about a main
            character, and could you work out why? Was the story too scary for
            your liking, or did it focus on a theme you didn't find interesting?
          </p>
          <p class="mt-10 mb-3 font-semibold text-gray-900">
            4. Round up your review
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            Summarise some of your thoughts on the book by suggesting the type
            of reader you'd recommend the book to. For example: younger readers,
            older readers, fans of relationship drama/mystery stories/comedy.
            Are there any books or series you would compare it to?
          </p>
          <p class="mt-10 mb-3 font-semibold text-gray-900">
            5. You can give the book a rating, for example a mark out of five or
            ten, if you like!
          </p>
